## 1. System Overview

The application is a football franchise simulation — a turn-based strategy game where users manage teams, configure playbooks, scout prospects, and simulate seasons. It runs as two completely independent services:

| Layer | Technology | Host | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|------|---------|
| **Backend** | Express + TypeScript + SQLite | Fly.io (`football-sim`, `iad` region) | Game logic, persistence, auth, API |
| **Frontend** | React + Vite SPA | Vercel (static deploy) | All UI, no server-side rendering |

The frontend talks to the backend exclusively via REST (`VITE_API_URL`). There is no shared runtime, no SSR, no WebSocket connection.

## 2. Core Layers

### 2.1 Simulation Engine (`src/engine/`)

The engine resolves individual plays via sequential phase pipelines. It receives a `Team` pair and a `PlayType`, and returns a `PlayEvent` with yards, result, and player attributions.

**Key files:**
- `simulateGame.ts` — drives the full game loop (quarters, downs, clock, special teams)
- `passEngine.ts` / `runEngine.ts` — resolve individual pass and run plays (not directly; these are called via `simulatePlay`)
- `config.ts` — all tuning constants (`TUNING` object). **LOCKED. Do not modify.**
- `playSelection.ts` — offensive play selection (tendencies, repetition, context, meta multipliers)
- `defensiveSelection.ts` — defensive play selection (scouting, halftime, coach intelligence)
- `gameStats.ts` — box score builder from `PlayEvent[]`

**Additional game mechanics** (layered on top of play resolution, in `simulateGame.ts`):
- Penalty system (6 types, checked after each play)
- PAT/2PT conversion after touchdowns
- Talent gap compression and trailing team boost
- Special teams scoring (return TDs, blocked kicks, pick-six, safeties)
- Clock model (real 15-min quarters with variable runoffs)
- Two-minute drill with timeout management and spike plays

**Critical invariant:** The engine only sees `PlayType` values (`inside_run`, `outside_run`, `short_pass`, `medium_pass`, `deep_pass`, `spike`). It has no knowledge of playbooks, formations, or routes. All strategy-layer logic must resolve to a `PlayType` before entering the engine.

### 2.2 League / Domain Model (`src/models/`)

The `League` interface is the root aggregate. It contains everything:

```
League
├── teams: Team[]
│   ├── roster: Player[]
│   ├── depthChart: DepthChart
│   ├── coaches: CoachingStaff
│   ├── tendencies: TeamTendencies
│   ├── offensivePlan?: OffensivePlan
│   ├── defensivePlan?: DefensivePlan
│   ├── playStats?: Record<string, PlayEffStats>
│   ├── customOffensivePlays?: OffensivePlay[]
│   ├── customDefensivePlays?: DefensivePlay[]
│   ├── customOffensivePlaybooks?: Playbook[]
│   ├── customDefensivePlaybooks?: DefensivePlaybook[]
│   └── scoutingData?: Record<string, ProspectScoutingState>
├── currentSeason: Season
│   └── games: Game[]
│       ├── events?: PlayEvent[]
│       └── boxScore?: GameBoxScore
├── freeAgents: Player[]
├── draftClass?: DraftClass
├── collegeData?: CollegeData
├── draft?: Draft
├── playoff?: PlayoffBracket
├── news: NewsItem[]
├── tradeProposals: TradeProposal[]
├── history: LeagueHistory
├── seasonHistory: SeasonRecord[]
├── gmCareer?: GmCareer
├── metaProfile?: MetaProfile
├── draftPickOwnership: Record<string, string>
└── currentSeasonStats: Record<string, PlayerSeasonStats>
```

**Assumption:** The entire `League` is deserialized, mutated in-memory, and re-serialized on every write. This is a deliberate simplicity trade-off. It works because leagues are single-digit MB and writes are infrequent (user actions, not real-time).

### 2.3 Persistence (`better-sqlite3`)

**Database:** Single SQLite file at `/data/football-sim.db` (Fly.io persistent volume).

**Tables:**
| Table | Schema | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `leagues` | `id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, stateJson TEXT` | Each league is one JSON blob |
| `users` | `id, username (COLLATE NOCASE), passwordHash` | Auth accounts |

**Access pattern:**
- `dbGetLeague(id)` — parse JSON from `stateJson` column
- `dbSaveLeague(league)` — serialize full `League` to JSON, write to `stateJson`

There is no ORM, no migrations framework, no query builder. Schema changes require manual `ALTER TABLE` or DB recreation.

**Risk:** The JSON blob approach means there is no referential integrity, no partial updates, and no indexing within league data. This is acceptable for the current scale (single-digit concurrent users per league). It would not scale to hundreds of simultaneous writers without a redesign.

### 2.4 Authentication & Multi-League

**Auth:**
- JWT Bearer tokens, 30-day lifetime
- Signed with `JWT_SECRET` environment variable
- Passwords hashed with `bcryptjs`
- No sessions, no cookies (`credentials: false` in CORS)
- `requireAuth` middleware attaches `{ userId, username }` to the request

**Multi-league:**
- A user can create or join multiple independent leagues
- Each league stores `commissionerId` (the creator) and per-team `ownerId` (claimed by users)
- `getUserTeam(league)` resolves the requesting user's team within a specific league

### 2.5 API Server (`src/server.ts`)

Single Express application with ~60 route handlers. All league-mutating routes follow the same pattern:

```typescript
app.post('/league/:id/some-action', requireAuth, (req, res) => {
  const league = getLeagueOrFail(req, res);  // load + auth check
  if (!league) return;
  // ... validate input ...
  // ... mutate league in memory ...
  dbSaveLeague(updated);
  sendLeague(res, updated);  // sanitize + respond
});
```

**`sendLeague`** calls `sanitizeLeagueForClient` before responding, which strips hidden prospect fields (`trueOverall`, `trueRatings`, `truePotential`, `trueRound`) to prevent scouting data leaks.

**CORS:** Origin whitelist from `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var. When `ALLOW_VERCEL_PREVIEWS=true`, any `*.vercel.app` origin is allowed.

### 2.6 Frontend (`web/src/`)

Single-page React application. Nearly all logic lives in one file:

- `App.tsx` (~8,000 lines) — most views as functions, `tab` state variable drives navigation
- `api.ts` — typed wrappers for every backend endpoint
- `types.ts` — TypeScript interfaces mirroring backend models (manually kept in sync)
- `App.css` — all styles in one file, dark theme with design token system
- `TeamLogo.tsx` — reusable team logo component (`/assets/teams/team_{abbr}.png` with fallback)
- `FieldView.tsx` — football field visualization with broadcast commentary
- `DashboardSchedule.tsx` — 18-week schedule strip component
- `views/PlaybooksView.tsx` — extracted playbook editor (~2,500 lines)
- `seasonStats.ts`, `boxScore.ts` — client-side stat aggregation
- `weeklyReport.ts`, `gameRecap.ts`, `gameplanRec.ts` — report generators

**Design system:** CSS custom properties for backgrounds (5-tier elevation), borders (3-tier), semantic colors, spacing scale, and typography (Barlow Condensed display / Barlow body / Space Mono code). Reusable primitives: `ui-card`, `ui-table`, `ui-badge`, `ui-stat`, `ui-empty`, `entity-link`.

**Team logos:** 32 PNG images at `web/public/assets/teams/team_{abbr}.png`. The `TeamLogo` component renders them with graceful fallback to abbreviation text if the image fails to load. Logos appear in dashboard, standings, game center, field view, playoff bracket, roster header, and schedule strip.

**Navigation model:** A `tab` state variable (`'dashboard' | 'roster' | 'draft' | ...`) determines which view function renders. There is no router library. URL does not change with navigation.

**Data flow:** The `league` object is fetched once on load and held in React state. Every mutation calls an API, receives the updated league, and calls `setLeague()`. The entire UI re-derives from the current `league` state.

---

## 3. Multi-League Isolation

### League-Scoped (fully isolated per league)

Everything inside the `League` object:
- Teams, rosters, depth charts, coaches
- Season state, games, play events, box scores
- Draft class, college data, scouting state
- Trade proposals, free agents, news
- History, awards, standings
- PlayStats, metaProfile, tendencies
- GM career, reputation
- Draft pick ownership

### User-Scoped (spans leagues)

- User account (id, username, password hash)
- JWT token (authenticates across all leagues)
- League membership list (which leagues the user belongs to)

### Global (shared, not league-specific)

- Static data libraries: `OFFENSIVE_PLAYS`, `DEFENSIVE_PLAYS`, `OFFENSIVE_FORMATIONS`, `DEFENSIVE_PACKAGES`, `PLAYBOOKS`, `DEFENSIVE_PLAYBOOKS`, `COLLEGE_CONFERENCES`
- Engine configuration: `TUNING` constants in `config.ts`
- Name pools for player/coach/prospect generation

**Invariant:** No mutable global state exists. All mutation happens within a league blob. Two leagues cannot affect each other through any code path.

## 4. Documentation Ownership Map

| Document | Owns | Do Not Duplicate Here |
|----------|------|----------------------|
| `ENGINE_STATE.md` | Final engine metrics, validation baselines, accepted gaps | Tuning constants (see LOCKED_VALUES) |
| `LOCKED_VALUES.md` | Frozen `config.ts` values with lock status | Engine behavior descriptions |
| `TUNING_LOG.md` | Chronological calibration change history | Current values (see LOCKED_VALUES) |
| `game-design.md` | Player ratings, overall formulas, pass/run pipeline phases | Playbook design, league structure |
| `FRANCHISE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md` | League structure, coaching, awards, history, playbook architecture, product philosophy | Engine math, rating formulas |
| `NEXT_STEPS.md` | Development roadmap, priorities, deferred systems | Design specifications |
| `PLAYBOOKS_AND_FORMATIONS.md` | Formation definitions, play structure, bucket logic | Engine pipeline details |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Developer instructions, codebase conventions, deployment | Long-term design decisions |

**Rule:** Each fact should live in exactly one document. If two documents say conflicting things about the same topic, the designated owner wins.

---

## 5. Safety Guidelines

### Engine Calibration

The simulation engine is validated against NFL statistical baselines (1000+ game sample). All constants in `config.ts` are frozen.

- **Never** modify values listed in `LOCKED_VALUES.md`
- **Never** add new engine math (sack calculations, completion formulas, yard distributions) without explicit approval
- Play selection weight modifiers (tendencies, repetition, context, meta, scouting) are safe to adjust — they sit above the engine and only affect which `PlayType` is chosen, not how it resolves

### Data Integrity

- **`sanitizeLeagueForClient` must be called on every response** that includes league data. Bypassing it leaks hidden prospect ratings to the client.
- **`draftPickOwnership` keys are format-sensitive:** `"${year}:${round}:${originalTeamId}"`. Malformed keys cause silent failures in draft order resolution.
- **Type sync is manual.** Backend types in `src/models/` and frontend types in `web/src/types.ts` must be kept in sync by hand. There is no codegen or shared type package.

### Source of Truth Discipline

- Do not create new documentation that overlaps with existing docs (see ownership map above)
- If a design decision is made, record it in the appropriate document, not in code comments
- `IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md` records what was built and why — it is a changelog, not a spec

---

## 6. Future Considerations

### Persistence Scaling

The JSON-blob-per-league approach has a ceiling. If leagues grow beyond ~10 MB or concurrent writers exceed single-digit users, consider:
- Splitting hot data (games, events) into separate tables
- Using transactions for atomic multi-field updates
- Adding an in-memory cache with write-through

**Assumption:** Current scale (< 10 leagues, < 5 concurrent users per league) is well within SQLite's capability.

### Frontend Architecture

`App.tsx` at ~10,000 lines is a maintenance risk. Natural decomposition points:
- Extract each view into its own file (`DashboardView.tsx`, `DraftView.tsx`, etc.)
- Introduce a lightweight router for URL-based navigation
- Consider a state management layer if prop drilling becomes unwieldy

**Assumption:** The single-file approach works for now because there is one primary developer and the file is well-organized with clear section comments.

### Type Safety

Backend and frontend types are manually synchronized. Drift is a real risk. Mitigation options:
- Shared types package in a monorepo
- Auto-generated types from the API schema
- Runtime validation at the API boundary (e.g., Zod)

**Assumption:** Manual sync is acceptable while the API surface is small and changes are infrequent.

### Historical Stats Storage

Player stat history is currently embedded in the league JSON blob. As seasons accumulate, this grows unbounded. Consider:
- Archiving old season data to separate storage
- Lazy-loading historical stats on demand
- Capping retained detail (e.g., keep summaries, drop play-by-play after N seasons)

### Playbook Data Model

Custom plays and playbooks are stored per-team inside the league blob. If the play library grows significantly:
- Consider a normalized play database separate from team state
- Add versioning so play definitions can be updated without breaking saved playbooks
